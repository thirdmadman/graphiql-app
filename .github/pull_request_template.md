## Pull Request Naming Convention

- Commits message should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)
- Do not put issue id in title
- Do not put WIP in title. Use [Draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) functionality
- Consider to add `area:*` label(s)

<!--
For pull requests that relate or close an issue, please include them
below.  We like to follow [Github's guidance on linking issues to pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

For example having the text: "closes #1234" would connect the current pull
request to issue 1234.  And when we merge the pull request, Github will
automatically close the issue.
